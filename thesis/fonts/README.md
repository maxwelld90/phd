# Fonts Used
Here's the thing. I use some custom fonts in my thesis; fonts that I have paid a licence for. As such, I cannot share these fonts publicly. I'd be pretty annoyed if my work was distributed for free online on some random repository (I know that feeling)... And yes, I have removed all instances of the fonts from prior commits, too.

Some fonts **are** free if you search for them online. Some fonts costed me money for a licence to use them. Given the fact the fonts came with different licences, I just removed them all from the repository to play it safe.

I'm sorry about that, but that's the way it is. This means you can't actually compile the PDF. Here are a list of the fonts that I have included in the directory on my local disk.

* Al Bayan (Arabic support)
* FreeFarsi (Persian support)
* Foundry Sterling Book
* Foundry Sterling Book Bold
* Foundry Sterling Book Italic
* Foundry Sterling Demi
* Noto Sans (Chinese, Japanese and Korean support)
* Padauk (Burmese support)
* Palatino Bold
* Palatino Bold Italic
* Palatino Italic
* Palatino Regular
* Sylfaen (Greek support)
* TH Sarabun (Thai support)

Why support for so many scripts? The acknowledgements. I wanted to acknowledge my friends, using their names in their native scripts. A nice touch.

If you're annoyed, here's a meme about fonts.
