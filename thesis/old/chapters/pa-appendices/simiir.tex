\chapter{The SimIIR Framework}\label{appx:simiir}
One of the key contributions of this thesis is the introduction of a framework enabling the simulation of interaction. 

\noindent
\blueboxbold{N.B.} Portions of this chapter are based upon the demonstration paper \emph{Simulating Interactive Information Retrieval: SimIIR: A Framework for the Simulation of Interaction}~\citep{maxwell2016simiir}. This demonstration was presented at the 39\textsuperscript{th} International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, held in Pisa, Italy. Additional components have however been included as the underlying searcher model was evolved during the course of this project.
