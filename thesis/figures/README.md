# Figures Used
This directory contains the PDF source files (and any bitmap images) corresponding to the figures displayed throughout my thesis. These files are all drawn in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html). Yes, it took a very, very long time to make all of these images, and to get them to the standard that I wanted. And yes, I purchased a subscription of Adobe CC 2017 for the duration of my writeup so I could use Illustrator.

These files are provided as-is; I'm not sure what you would want to do with them, but the evidence of my hard work is here in the commit history. If you do decide to use one of these images, please credit me as per the instructions in the [README file located in the root directory](https://github.com/maxwelld90/phd/blob/master/README.md).

## Use of Stock Images
I made it clear in the front matter of this thesis that not all of the illustrations used throughout this thesis are my original work. While the concepts for the artwork are entirely original and devised by me (unless where otherwise stated in the text), many of the small constituent artwork files are from the fantastic artwork site, [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com). If you do credit me for an image, you **must** also credit freepik.com. I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank the talented artists who put their work on freepik for me to use. I appreciate it; I hope the credit is enough (I am certain what I have done is okay, as per the freepik attribution rules); and I hope you like the end result.
