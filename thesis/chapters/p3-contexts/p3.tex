\part[Examining Searcher Stopping Behaviours]{In this part of the thesis, we present our \darkbluebox{empirical contributions}, examining what happens to searcher stopping behaviours under \darkbluebox{different contexts}. We then report on a number of different \darkbluebox{simulated analyses}, examining our proposed stopping strategies. Finally, we report on an empirical analysis of the new \darkbluebox{\gls{acr:serp} level stopping decision point}.}{Examining and Simulating Searcher Stopping Behaviours}\label{part:context}
