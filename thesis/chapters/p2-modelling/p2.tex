\part[Modelling and Methodology]{In the second part of the thesis, we introduce the \darkbluebox{Complex Searcher Model (CSM)} that provides a more realistic, conceptual model of the information seeking process. We also detail a series of \darkbluebox{operationalised stopping strategies} that we will apply as part of our \darkbluebox{general methodology}. This details how we instantiate the CSM and other components in subsequent chapters.}{Modelling and\\Methodology}\label{part:stopping}
