\part[Advancing User Modelling]{In this part of the thesis, we introduce the \darkbluebox{Complex Searcher Model (CSM)}. The CSM provides a more complex and realistic conceptual model of the~\gls{acr:iir} process. Embedded within the CSM is a new \darkbluebox{stopping decision point} â€“ this is analysed in detail, allowing us to determine whether it enjoys better approximations of actual searcher behaviours.}{Advancing User\\Modelling in~\gls{acr:iir}}\label{part:stopping}
