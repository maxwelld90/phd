Thank you so much for agreeing to be part of my PhD viva panel. I really appreciate the time, effort and dedication that you will put into examining the result of four years of hard graft.

It may look long -- this version is 465 pages in total. The template stretches content out, and there are a lot of carefully drawn figures present. However, I am very proud of the work that I have put into this, and I hope that you will be able to see just how much effort was spent -- not only in terms of content but in terms of presentation, too. The word count stands at 78,442 words, just below the 80,000 word limit set by the College. I hope the illustrations along the way make the read more enjoyable.

Thank you again. See you in the viva!
