Thank you so much for agreeing to be part of my PhD viva panel. I really appreciate the time, effort and dedication that you will put into examining the research I have worked on over the past four years.

It may look long; the template stretches content out, and there are a lot of figures present. However, I'm very proud of the work that I have put into this, and hope you will be able to see how much effort went into it -- not only in terms of content, but in terms of presentation, too. The word count of this thesis at submission time weighs in at 63,800, well below the 80,000 limit mandated by the College. I hope the illustrations along the way make the read more enjoyable.

Thank you again. I look forward to discussing this work with you in the viva!

David
