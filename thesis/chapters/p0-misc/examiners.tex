Thank you so much for agreeing to be part of my PhD viva panel. I really appreciate the time, effort and dedication that you will put into examining the research I have worked on over the past four years.

It may look long; perhaps the template stretches content out, and there are a lot of figures present. However, I'm very proud of the work that I have put into this, and hope you will be able to see how much effort went into it -- not only in terms of content, but in terms of presentation, too. I should also add that in my final acknowledgements section, I will be crediting the authors of various free artworks that I have used throughout the thesis, along with many, many others.

I look forward to discussing this work with you in the viva!

--David
