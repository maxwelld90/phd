\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{The PhD Journey}

A good friend of mine (and a fellow PhD student) once said to me that when the time came to write his PhD thesis, he would avoid an acknowledgements section where \emph{everyone and their dog} would be thanked for helping him reach his ultimate goal of attaining a PhD. I on on the other hand take a very different light on this matter. There are a lot of people who have in one way or another helped me to reach where I am today. Whether these people actively guided me in my studies, or were individuals who I was fortunate to become acquainted with over the past five years, they all \emph{``cajoled''}\footnote{Professor Ian Ruthven used it in his PhD thesis~\citep{ruthven2001phd} as a means of describing the individuals who were there for him, behind the scenes, \emph{``cajoling''} him to complete his thesis.} me in one way or another towards the finishing line.

I firmly believe that everybody who I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with 


\todo{=====}


I firmly believe that everybody who I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with over the past five years should be acknowledged -- whether or not they feel they contributed in any meaningful way. If you are one of these people and are left wondering, believe me: \emph{you did make a difference.} \textbf{\emph{To show my sincere appreciation, I want to dedicate this work to each and every one of them}} -- regardless of whether they have a dog or not.

Hindsight tells me that doing a PhD is much like embarking on a \emph{very long,} solo journey. Unless you do one yourself, you won't appreciate how tough (and lonely) it can be at times. Three years in, I found myself sitting in my lab all alone on a Friday night, wondering why my experiments weren't producing the results I had expected and hoped for.\footnote{It was a stupid mistake; from memory, I forgot to increment a counter in a loop. But it took an entire evening to figure that out. \emph{Of course it did!}} It can all seem so very pointless, and you question why you're doing what you're doing. I experienced these lows more times than I care to admit. It can be tortuous. \emph{Impostor syndrome} is something that every PhD student feels, and I was no exception.

However, I got to the finishing line. Doing a PhD isn't just about learning your field of study and contributing to it; no, it's much more than that. It also involves learning about yourself. It's \emph{character building.} It involves steely grit and determination to get through the difficult times. Even when everything comes crashing down around you, \emph{you will get through it.} \emph{I got through it.} My PhD taught me this more than anything, and for that I am incredibly thankful. I'm definitely a different person for having done it -- a much better one (I think so, anyway!), equipped with a good skillset to enter the world and make a positive contribution. Even though every PhD comes complete with negative moments, I took positives from all of them. From this, I could enjoy the good times even more. And believe me, there were \emph{heaps} of good times during the past five years.

Sitting in my favourite coffee shop as I write this\footnote{...even though I'm not a coffee drinker! If you are ever in Glasgow's West End, go to \emph{Offshore} on Gibson Street. It's superb. And if you love dogs, you'll like it even more.}, watching people come and go as I take a pause from staring at my laptop's screen, I am made acutely aware that each individual has their own unique story to tell. Everyone's experiences -- from all walks of life -- are different, making for a virtually limitless number of possible stories to listen to -- and to learn from. I have always found this truth about life to be absolutely fascinating.

So, on that basis, I would like to briefly present the \emph{story of my PhD journey,} acknowledging everyone who made a positive impact along the way. I think that investing additional time in writing this short passage is a good reflective experience, and also serves to emphasise how much all of the individuals that I mention mean to me.

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

The beginning is usually a good place to start -- October 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2013. Sitting down in my new office in SAWB221\footnote{\emph{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwyn_Williams_(geologist)}{Sir Alwyn Williams} Building (SAWB)}, the home of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow.} with relatively new faces around me, I remember thinking something along the lines of \emph{what have I just let myself in for?} After a proclamation from my supervisor, Leif, I was given my trusty laptop that served me throughout my PhD, and the hard work began.

And what a lot of hard work it was! Little did I know that the work I started on that day would lead to the successes that I experienced. From the publications that I accrued, I was granted many different opportunities to travel the world.\footnote{Have a look at the flags at the start of this section to see what countries I was fortunate enough to travel to.} Travelling solo was something I had not yet done before my PhD; by the end of the process, I had done this countless times, delivering presentations at conferences all over the globe. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have had these opportunities, and the opportunities to meet such amazing and inspiring people from different backgrounds and cultures.

But what about the people at Glasgow?  would not ha

And what a lot of hard work it was! However, I wouldn't have had it any other way. Little did I know at the beginning that the work would lead to a number of different publications. From these successes, I was granted many opportunities to travel the world. Being exposed to new countries\footnote{Have a look at the flags at the start of this section to see where I travelled to.} and cultures was perhaps one of the highlights of the entire process. The so-called \emph{impostor syndrome} that plagues PhD students of course was prevalent; but with each flight that I boarded, every hand that I shook, and every presentation that I gave, the confidence that I was doing something that people considered to be worthy increased.

Leif -- make him a common theme. And come back to him for a paragraph of his own at the end. When you mention the opportunities, mention TwD -- and that the first edition came online on day one of the PhD!

The beginning is usually a good place to start. October 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2013. Sitting in my new office with (relatively) new faces around me, I remember thinking something along the lines of \emph{what have I just let myself in for?} Day one consisted of acquiring my laptop that accompanied me throughout my PhD, and being given my first job: running a user study. Several months later, I found myself having completed my first paper.

- and there were several publications.
- all of which led to opportunities to travel the world.
- admittedly, never really been abroad before the phd save for one trip to the united states in 2009.
- the opportunity to do a phd -- and seemingly be successful at it -- gave me the chance to address this one thing i had never really done solo before -- travel.

- and by travelling the world, i have met so many of the amazing individuals that i mention here.
- gone to so many countries, too! the start of this section shows the flags of the countries i visited, and when.

- many conferences around the world, and summer schools too.
    - started at ECIR 2014 in amsterdam.
    - with the first presentation 

- i did not think for one minute that in the intermediatary four years, i would drive along the Pacific Highway in New South Wales, or have drinks with my good friend Jarana in downtown Tokyo.
- during my phd, i have been incredibly fortunate to undertake interesting experiments.

- importantly, a number of officemates came and went and offered support.
- to the people in SAWB rooms 220 and 221 -- thanks.
    - special mention to stewart whiting for his guidance and support at the end.
    - maybe thank everyone.
    - horatiu -- i need to thank you, too. you were part of the journey from day one. sorry about whatever happened with you at the end.

- to those in the school of computing science.
    - thanks to simon rogers for your support.
    - rod murray-smith
    - helen, gail, teresa, lisa.
        - so enjoyable to be a tutor
        - thanks to Quintin Cutts for granting me the opportunity to do this way back in 2013 -- being responsible for the entire first year lab for two hours on a monday afternoon!
        
        - and from the tutoring, i met a lot of fantastic people who showed a keenness to learn and progress.
            - katie, ivelina, david, leisha, alex, mihail, lisa, rebekka, vincent...
            - to name but a few.
    
    - learning to be a good tutor from...
    - yashar. thank you for everything.
        - showing me the ropes for java programming in 2009.
        - the friendship from thereon in and support and advice.
        - and your expertise in helping with the running of the crowdsourced user studies.



- mentioned all of the opportunities i have had.
- and there's one person who i would not have had these opporunities if it wasn't for him.
- leif azzopardi.

\todo{Anastasia, Helen McNeee, Autumn School (ASIRF), MUMIA (Tampere, Summer School), SoCS RSC Funding,... Thank Alastair for his careful and tireless reviewing of the thesis. Thanks to Yashar for helping with the user studies and his AMT expertise. Do I want to remove Horatiu from this? I need to thank Leif some more. When my world came crashing down in late 2014, and indeed during the end of the writeup phase because of personal issues, he was there to support me. And without such an understanding supervisor, I probably wouldn't have been able to have got this far. Thanks to the hundreds of students that I have had the pleasure of tutoring over the years! To name but a few, Katy Alexandrova, Alex Pancheva, Lisa Laux, Matthew Cornetto, blah blah... -- When thanking David Hawking for the time in Canberra, thanks to Kathy, too. Sorry to the College for it taking a bit longer than I had thought it would take, but it seems that that is usually the way when writing a PhD thesis. Thanks to Simon Rodgers and Iadh Ounis for their support. Thanks to David White for his feedback early on, shaping and improving my writing as I revised the content. Thanks to the AMT folk who did the experiment for us.}

Everyone has their life, and there's so many stories in this world. Here's mine from the past four years, and an acknowledgement of some of the amazing individuals I have been lucky enough to meet.

THANKS EVERYONE WHO HAS WORKED ON THE STUFF BEFORE ME TO ALLOW ME TO INVESTIGATE THIS REALLY INTERESTING AREA.

Leif, when my world collapsed around me, you were there to support me, to listen and provide guidance. I cannot thank you enough for the faith you bestowed upon me that I would get things done. Elaborate on Yashar a bit more, thanks for your help with the two user studies, your expert help on the crowdsourcing. I learnt a lot from you in this regard. Thanks for your support, too, through the tough times. You've always been someone I can talk to when I need it the most.




A good friend of mine -- and a fellow PhD student -- once said to me that when the time came to write his PhD thesis, he would avoid an acknowledgements section where \emph{everyone and their dog} would be thanked for being part of his life. I on the other hand take a very different light on this matter; there are a lot of people who have helped me get to where I am today in some form. \textbf{\emph{To show my appreciation, I want to dedicate this work to each and every one of them}} -- regardless of whether they have a dog or not.

So, where do I begin? I guess day one of the PhD is a good place to start -- October 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2013. Sitting in my new office with (relatively) new faces around me, I remember thinking something along the lines of \emph{what have I just let myself in for?} But despite the occasional set of disappointing results, the existential questioning of \emph{what am I doing}, along with the challenges I've faced outside my PhD, I've got through to the other side complete with a much better understanding of my subject and life in general -- as well as countless good memories to go with all of that. I did not for one minute think that within the intermediary four years, I would drive along the Pacific Highway in New South Wales, wander the streets of New York City with my friend Hora\c{t}iu, or have drinks with my friend Jarana in downtown Tokyo. During my PhD, I have been incredibly fortunate to undertake interesting experiments (that \emph{did} work), and as a perk of getting them published, travel the world. And in doing so, I have met some amazing people with whom I have had the opportunity to share what I have been working on -- and indeed, learn from. As Professor Ian Ruthven pointed out in his own 2001 thesis, there may only be one name on the front page of a PhD, but countless numbers of people behind the scenes who were involved in the making of it, \emph{``cajoling''} the author (as Ian put it) towards the finishing line.

To the people in \emph{SAWB} Rooms 220 and 221 -- my friends, Colin Wilkie, Jarana Manotumruksa, Stuart Mackie, Stewart Whiting, Fatma Elsafoury, David Paule, James McMinn, Xi Yang, Rami Alkhawaldeh, Fajie Yuan, Phil McParlane, Jesus Perez and his brother Felix, and Shawki Al-Dubaee. Thank you all for your friendship and the good times we have shared. Thank you also to Frances Cooper, G\"{o}zel Shakeri, Craig Reilly, James Trimble, Blair Archibald, Laura Voinea and Natascha Harth for your friendship. To Sean McKeown, it has been an absolute pleasure -- and I know you are doing Edinburgh Napier proud. Most of all though, my thanks to Hora\c{t}iu Bota for your continued friendship as we progressed through our respective PhDs -- \emph{we made it!}

To the Head of School, Professor Chris Johnson -- and Dr. Simon Rogers -- thank you both for the support and trust you bestowed upon me throughout my PhD. To Dr. Yashar Moshfeghi, thank you for your friendship, wisdom and advice throughout the years -- even as my tutor when I was a second year undergraduate! To Professor Rod Murray-Smith, thank you for your feedback and assistance in shaping this thesis into what it is now. Your support after Leif moved to the University of Strathclyde was invaluable. To Helen Border, Gail Reat and Teresa Bonner in the teaching office, I am so glad I could help out with my tutoring and exam collection efforts throughout the years. I enjoyed every second of my tutoring jobs -- I hope that over the eight years I tutored, I got \emph{something} through to a student who was struggling. Indeed, thank you to everyone else in the School of Computing Science who made my time there such an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

To those in the College of Science and Engineering -- especially Heather Lambie -- thank you for letting me disappear several times to go do internships elsewhere. I know it is a pain seeing students disappear for months at a time, so it makes me appreciate your efforts even more. Generally, thank you to the University of Glasgow for providing me with the opportunity to show the world what I can do, and to the \emph{EPSRC} for providing me with a PhD scholarship to get this work done without any financial headaches.\footnote{I acknowledge the financial support offered by the UK Government (through the EPSRC), under grant number \texttt{1367507}.}

To my PhD examiners -- both my internal examiner, \todo{Dr. Some Guy}, and my external examiner, \todo{Dr. Another Guy} at \todo{Some University, Some Country}. I know just how much effort you both put into reading this thesis, and I hope I was able to provide you with the clarity, detail and presentation that you both expected. Thanks to you both for the work you put into assessing this thesis. My thanks also goes to my viva convenor, \todo{Dr. Convenor Person}, for the time and effort in ensuring the examination process was swift and (relatively) painless.

In September 2014, I spent several weeks in Tampere, Finland. Here, I had the opportunity to work with world leaders regarding user modelling and simulation of the Interactive Information Retrieval process. Thank you to Professor Kalervo J\"{a}rvelin, Dr. Jaana Kek\"{a}l\"{a}inen, Dr. Heikki Keskustalo, Teemu P\"{a}\"{a}kk\"{o}nen and Dr. Feza Baskaya for a fantastic, rewarding and memorable time. I learnt so much from you all, and this reflected in the simulation software that was developed during my PhD -- including use of your prototypical querying strategies.

To my good friends Vu Tran and Ioannis Karatassis, thanks for the wonderful time I spent at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany in late November to early December 2015. Thank you also to Professor Norbert Fuhr for allowing me to visit, for his counsel, and allowing me to participate on developing the interesting work that we were able to present at the third \emph{International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval} in Amsterdam.

To Professor Jaap Kamps at the University of Amsterdam -- thank you for your Doctoral Consortium mentorship at the first \emph{Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval} in North Carolina. The feedback you provided on my work allowed me to formulate some new ideas which subsequently made it into this thesis.

To Johanne and Penny, thank you both for everything you did for me when I visited in Melbourne. To Mostafa and Samira, thank you both for everything you did for me when I visited in Amsterdam. Mostafa, the moped ride from Sloterdijk station was \emph{awesome!} The kindness you all showed me was very much appreciated, and I am happy to repay this at any time.

My thanks also to Dr. Peter Bailey, Dr. Paul Thomas and Professor Dave Hawking for the memorable time at Microsoft Australia. The kindness and support shown by you all was very much appreciated. I learnt so much from my time there -- and this has undoubtedly equipped me to become a better scientist. Thank you so much. To Gabrielle, James, Alan and Az -- it was a pleasure to meet you all, and thank you for your continued friendships. I have nothing but fond memories of my times in Canberra.

I was also fortunate enough to become an intern at the \emph{Alan Turing Institute} in London, during the Summer of 2017. While this internship was not directly applicable to my PhD (nor was my time at Microsoft, for that matter), I did learn lots about a new area -- and of course, had the opportunity to meet and work with some wonderful people. To Emily Neilson, Professor Terry Lyons, Dr. Hao Ni, Dr. Jeremy Reizenstein, Alexandru Cioba, Rados\l{}aw Kowalski, Tim King, James Bell, Haichen Shi and William Kayat  -- to name but a few -- thank you for your friendship and support throughout my time as an intern, and to the Alan Turing Institute for a wonderful experience. Indeed, the Institute is fantastic place to work, with so many bright minds working together. I hope to be able to visit again in the future.

To my mother, Denise, my father, William, and my brother, Alastair -- thank you all for your unwavering support, love and encouragement. It was tough at times. But all three of you were always there for me. I am so happy I have been able to do you all proud. \emph{There is another doctor in the family, now!} To Ian Phillips -- you were the person who taught me everything I needed to know about computing at Standard Grade and Advanced Higher.\footnote{Standard Grades and Advanced Highers were the Scottish qualifications that you obtained from school and/or college, although it seems as though everything has changed since I was a high school student.} As my high school teacher, you were one of the people most conducive in helping me get to where I am today. Thank you so much for everything you did for me at Mearns Castle High School, and I hope I have made you and the School proud. I sometimes look back at my Advanced Higher project and question what on earth I was doing -- I \emph{think} this shows that I have come a long way with everything that I have learnt since 2008. I remember thinking the software I wrote back then as being so complex; it now seems so simple.

Finally, I wish to thank my supervisor, Dr. Leif Azzopardi. Leif has seen me through so much -- from my undergraduate Honours and Masters projects, and now as my PhD supervisor. His advice, wisdom, expertise and friendship have been instrumental in getting me to the stage that I could actually write this thesis up. Leif gave me so many opportunities, bestowed faith and trust in me, and provided support and encouragement when I was feeling down. I cannot express thanks enough for everything Leif has done for me. \emph{Thank you so much, Leif!} I hope we will work together again in the future.

Yes, the past four years have been an incredible journey. At times everything felt overwhelming -- like what I was doing was simply impossible. But with the love and support from everyone mentioned above, I got through it, and have managed to produce an original piece of research. With that has come a newfound confidence in myself that I will be able to achieve my future goals, whatever they may be. I think producing this thesis is testament to that, and it is something that I am very proud of.

But do you know what?
