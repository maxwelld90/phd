This version of my PhD thesis has been published by the \textit{British Computer Society (BCS)}, part of the award for the {\headerfont Council of Professors and Heads of Computing (CPHC)/BCS Distinguished Dissertation Award} for 2019-2020. Front matter of this version has been slightly altered---but all other content remains the same as the original version.

For nominating my work, I'd like to take this opportunity thank my PhD examiners, Professor Iadh Ounis \textit{(University of Glasgow, Scotland)} and Dr Suzan Verberne \textit{(Universiteit Leiden, The Netherlands)} for doing so. I would also like to thank the academics who wrote recommendations supporting the nomination, and the organisers of the award at the CPHC/BCS. Finally, I would also like to thank my supervisor, Dr Leif Azzopardi. Without his support, friendship, and encouragement over the years, I wouldn't have got to this point today.
