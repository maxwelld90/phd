Searching is a complex and inherently interactive process. During a search session, searchers may issue multiple queries and examine a varying number of result summaries and documents per query. Searchers must also decide when to stop assessing content for relevance, or decide when to stop their search session altogether. Despite being such a fundamental activity, only a limited number of studies have explored stopping behaviours in detail, with a majority reporting that searchers stop because they feel that what they have found feels \emph{``good enough''.} Notwithstanding the limited exploration of stopping during search, the phenomenon is central to the study of \emph{Information Retrieval,} playing a role in the models and measures that we employ. However, the current \emph{de facto} assumption considers that searchers will examine $k$ documents -- examining up to a \emph{fixed depth.}

In this thesis, we examine people's stopping behaviours under a number of different search contexts. We report on two user studies, examining how result summary lengths and a variation of search tasks and goals affect stopping behaviours. Interaction data from these studies is then used to ground extensive \emph{simulations of interaction,}  exploring a number of different \emph{stopping heuristics} (operationalised as twelve \emph{stopping strategies}). We consider how well the proposed strategies perform and match up with real-world stopping behaviours. As part of our contribution, we also propose a high-level conceptual searcher model, the \emph{Complex Searcher Model,} that encodes stopping behaviours at different points throughout the search process. As part of the Complex Searcher Model, we also propose a new results page stopping decision point. This allows searchers to obtain an impression of the page before deciding to \emph{enter} or \emph{abandon} it, based upon its \emph{information scent.}

Results presented and discussed in this thesis show that searchers employ a variation of different stopping strategies, with their behaviours clearly not fixed. We demonstrate that stopping behaviours are clearly variable in nature, reinforcing the idea that modelling such a phenomenon is difficult. However, simplistic stopping strategies offer good performance and real-world searcher approximations, such as the \emph{frustration}-based stopping strategy that considers a searcher's tolerance to non-relevance. We also find that \emph{combination} strategies -- such as those combining a searcher's \emph{satisfaction} with finding relevant material, and their frustration towards observing non-relevant material -- also offer good approximations and performance. In addition, we also demonstrate that the inclusion of the additional stopping decision point within the Complex Searcher Model provides significant improvements to performance over our baseline implementation, and offers better approximations to real-world searcher stopping behaviours.

This work motivates a revision of how we currently model the search process, and demonstrates that different stopping heuristics need to be considered within the models and measures that we consider in Information Retrieval. Measures should be reformed according to the stopping behaviours of searchers. This work also opens up a number of potential avenues for future exploration, such as modelling the stopping behaviours of searchers individually (rather than as a population), and to explore and consider a wider variety of different stopping heuristics under different search contexts. Despite the inherently difficult task that understanding and modelling the stopping behaviours of searchers represents, potential benefits of further exploration in this area will undoubtedly bring benefits to the searchers of future retrieval systems, with improved interfaces and experiences.
