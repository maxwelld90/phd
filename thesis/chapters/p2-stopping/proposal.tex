\chapter[Models and Proposal]{Research Proposal and\\IIR Modelling}\label{chap:proposal}
Having established the prior work that has been undertaken in the field of~\gls{acr:iir} concerning stopping behaviours, we in this chapter outline the approaches we follow in the remainder of the thesis, considering: \emph{(i)} the different stopping strategies that we will employ (Section~\ref{sec:proposal:strategies}); \emph{(ii)} introduce the \emph{Complex Searcher Model (CSM)}, our development of state of the art user models (Section~\ref{sec:proposal:csm}); and \emph{(iii)} provide a detailed explanation of the methodology that we will employ in the remainder of the thesis (Section~\ref{sec:proposal:method}).

\section{Selected Stopping Strategies}\label{sec:proposal:strategies}
From the literature, we identified a number of different \emph{stopping heuristics} that had been defined in an attempt to model when individuals stop searching (in the context of information seeking), or when animals stop foraging for food. In this section, we enumerate a series of these different heuristics as \emph{stopping strategies}, which we define as concrete implementations of an aforementioned heuristic. We then employ these strategies as part of our mixed methodology, described in Section~\ref{sec:proposal:method}.

\subsection{Baseline Strategy}

\subsection{Tolerance to Non-Relevance}

\subsection{Considering the Difference}

\subsection{Goal/Satisfaction Based}

\subsection{Time-Based Rules}

\subsection{Combination Rule}

\subsection{Optimal Foraging Rule}

\section{The Complex Searcher Model}\label{sec:proposal:csm}

\subsection{Stopping Decision Points}

\subsection{CSM Mark I}

\subsection{CSM Mark II}

\subsection{Considering State and Agency}

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:proposal:method}

We want to examine what happens to a searcher's behaviour when different stopping rules are employed under certain contexts.
How can we do this?

\subsection{Conducting a User Study}

\subsection{Performing a Simulated Analysis}
Simulation as defined earlier is a good means for experimentation.
