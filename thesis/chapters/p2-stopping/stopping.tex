\chapter[A Background of Stopping in IIR]{A Background of Stopping in\\Interactive Information Retrieval}\label{chap:stopping_background}

In the previous chapter, we provided a high level overview of~\gls{acr:ir}. In particular, we provided a brief history of the area, the basic families of retrieval models, and various measures that have traditionally been used to evaluate the effectiveness of a retrieval system. Towards the end of the chapter, we began to shift from the \emph{system-sided} research that has dominated~\gls{acr:ir} research (and quite understandably so), towards the more \emph{user-centred} research with which the work in this thesis considers. In particular, as alluded to in Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}, and indeed in the title of this thesis, we now turn our attention to the concept of \emph{stopping behaviour} in the context of~\gls{acr:iir}.

With many of the models and measures employed in~\gls{acr:ir} and~\gls{acr:iir} research today largely agnostic of a searcher's stopping behaviour, we in this chapter provide an overview of a variety of different \emph{stopping heuristics} that have been defined in the literature over a number of decades, provide a discussion on a number of different user studies that have examined searcher stopping behaviours, discuss basic theoretical frameworks that provide a potential insight and explanation into why people stop, and then discuss a variety of different user models that have been developed that better attempt to model a searcher's interactions, and thus allow for a better representation of their stopping behaviour.

\section{Why Stopping?}
As previously mentioned, knowing when to stop is a fundamental aspect of human thinking and behaviour. Humans and other animals when interacting with the world will employ some form of \emph{stopping criterion} to decide when they should stop~\citep{nickles1995judgment}. As an example, a shopper who is looking to purchase a new smartphone will stop shopping around once he or she has obtained sufficient information on what new smartphone to purchase. Once their case notes for a patient have been compiled, a medical doctor will then be in a position to diagnose the patient's ailment.

The decision of when to stop is not exclusively due to factors external to the decision maker, but rather from a series of \emph{internal, cognitive factors} of their thinking process~\citep{nickles1995judgment}. An individual who is hungry will stop eating once he or she is no longer hungry, rather than stopping when all of the food presented to him or her has been consumed. Empirical research has over the years demonstrated that individuals, regardless of the task presented to them, will frequently stop prematurely. Indeed, this na\"{i}ve behaviour demonstrates that individuals may be willing to go with what \emph{``sounds right''} to them -- often minimising the cognitive effort that is required at the expense of greater accuracy~\citep{perkins1983difficulties}. However, this lower level of potential accuracy does lead searchers to making a greater number of errors in their decision making~\citep{baron1988heuristics}, with individuals overlooking important elements, and potentially miss out useful information~\citep{fischhoff1977cost_benefit, fischhoff1978fault, shafir1992thinking}, with the individual then failing to consider alternatives~\citep{farquhar1993decision_structuring}.

Based upon prior research into the phenomenon of stopping behaviour, it is clear that this is driven primarily from internal factors. As such, we then consider: \emph{what aspects of the decision maker's thinking processes prompt him or her to stop assessing the information provided?} Knowing when to stop requires that the individual in question makes a \emph{judgement} regarding the sufficiency of the information obtained, and whether or not additional information is required to be obtained~\citep{browne2004stopping_rules}. This judgement is normally characterised by both the completeness and correctness of the information obtained thus far~\citep{smith1991belief}. These claims can be mirrored by qualitative studies on examining stopping behaviour, where researchers have found that searchers stop examining a ranked list of results simply because what they have found previously is \emph{``good enough''}~\citep{wu2014information_scent}, echoing the reasoning that individuals will be happy to stop when what they have found \emph{``sounds right''}~\citep{perkins1983difficulties}.

\section{Stopping Heuristics}\label{sec:stopping_background:heuristics}
Considering the above, researchers have over a number of decades devised a number of different high level \emph{stopping rules} -- hereafter referred to as \emph{stopping heuristics} -- as a means of encoding a searcher's aforementioned sense of what is \emph{``good enough''} -- or, indeed, what can be considered to be \emph{not good enough,} too.

Stopping heuristics have been investigated in \emph{decision making} research. A number of normative stopping heuristics have been identified. As examples of such heuristics,~\cite{busemeyer1988deferred_decision_making} considered the expected loss from terminating information acquisition.~\cite{kogut1990sunk_costs} examined the expected value of additional information. Other examples of normative stopping heuristics are demonstrated by~\cite{pitz1969information_seeking} and~\cite{busemeyer1988deferred_decision_making}. However, as outlined by~\cite{browne2004stopping_rules}, these heuristics usually fail to describe the actual cognitive behaviours of the decision makers. Such heuristics often assume that the decision maker must \emph{think ahead} to the final decision of when to stop, enabling them to assess the value of additional information~\citep{busemeyer1988deferred_decision_making}. This is however an inherently difficult task for decision makers to undertake, due to the limited working memory capacity of a human -- humans are simply unable to hold and evaluate all of the information attained to make a decision considering all possible outcomes~\citep{browne2004stopping_rules}.~\cite{nickles1995judgment} also argued that the normative stopping heuristics made implicit assumptions about the mental activities of the decision maker, especially in terms of mental scaling and weighting. No clear cognitive perspective is provided to address the assumptions of the decision maker's thinking, and thus their decision to stop.

With these inherent limitations in mind, seminal work in this area was undertaken by~\cite{nickles1995judgment} who provided a broad classification for different explicitly defined stopping heuristics in the literature that consider a searcher's cognitive processes: \emph{judgement based heuristics} and \emph{reasoning based heuristics.}~\cite{nickles1995judgment} also proposed a number of stopping heuristics that are discussed in subsequent sections, with discussion expanded to included additional heuristics defined by other researchers.

These are highlighted in the illustration as {\color{dmax_lightblue}blue} diamonds.

    \label{fig:model_two_points}
\end{figure}

\noindent\blueboxbold{Considering Stopping Decision Points} It is important to note that in the context of search, stopping heuristics have often been discussed at two key \emph{stopping decision points} in the literature. To demonstrate this, Figure~\ref{fig:model_two_points} illustrates an excerpt from a basic user model that highlights these two key stopping decision points. In the figure, decision point \blueboxbold{1} considers \emph{snippet level stopping} -- often referred to as \emph{query level stopping} in the literature.\footnote{In this thesis, we use the terminology \emph{snippet level stopping} to avoid potential confusion between this well defined stopping decision point, and a further one that we introduce in Chapter~\ref{chap:proposal}.} This stopping decision point addresses the issue of how deep a searcher should examine a ranked list of results presented to him or her on a given SERP. In addition to this, the second stopping decision point, \blueboxbold{2}, as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:model_two_points}, considers wider \emph{session level stopping}. This stopping decision point permits a searcher to determine whether they have met their overall search goal, have run out of time, or have simply become exasperated with the lack of promising results. While these two key stopping decision points are discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:proposal:stopping_points}, it should be noted that the heuristics defined in this section can be applied to snippet level stopping, session level stopping, or both.

\subsection{Judgement Based Heuristics}
A judgement based stopping heuristic is defined as when a decision maker is assumed to set and consistently maintain a mental threshold along some form of key dimension (e.g. determining the seemingly relevant from non-relevant), and to keep a running total of measure relative to the dimension in question~\citep{gettys1979hypothesis, nickles1995judgment}. When the measure is met or exceeded this set threshold, the searcher then stops and proceeds to the next step, or abandons the search altogether. A number of different judgement based heuristics have been defined in the literature, the most prominent of which we discuss here.

\subsubsection{Satisfaction and Frustration}
Two of the earliest stopping heuristics defined in the literature are by~\cite{cooper1973retrieval_effectiveness_ii} which consider a searcher's tolerance to relevant and non-relevant material. The heuristics were originally defined as a means for estimating the utility a searcher can attain when interacting with a search system. While the means of which~\cite{cooper1973retrieval_effectiveness_ii} estimated the utility of search are not of key relevance to this thesis, the work on stopping heuristics are. The \emph{satisfaction point} and \emph{frustration point} stopping heuristics are considered to be judgement based heuristics, as they rely solely on the searcher's notion of what constitutes a relevant document -- and both consider counts of the number of (non-)relevant documents observed.

\noindent\blueboxbold{Satisfaction Point}
Given the name, it is not surprising that the \emph{satisfaction point} rule considers the point at which a searcher has found enough perceived relevant material to consider his or her search a success. It can be easily imagined that such a rule would apply directly to both snippet level stopping (i.e. \emph{find $x$ relevant documents on this SERP}) and session level stopping (i.e. \emph{find $x$ relevant documents}). This heuristic is also called the \emph{satiation heuristic} (see below).

\noindent\blueboxbold{Frustration Point}
In a converse fashion to the satisfaction point heuristic, the \emph{frustration point} heuristic considers a searcher's overall \emph{tolerance to non relevance}, by stopping after being sufficiently frustrated by the results presented to the searcher. This heuristic is also called the \emph{disgust heuristic} in the literature (see below).

The two relatively straightforward heuristics defined above makes a searcher's interactions with a ranked list of results, or SERPs, \emph{inherently adaptive.} Given a set of results, his or her behaviour will change with respect to the perceived quality of the ranked list of results. As a reminder, this would not necessarily mean considering the system's effectiveness measures, but rather user-focused measures such as interactive precision and recall (refer to Section~\ref{sec:ir_background:user:evaluation:interactive_pr}).

\noindent\blueboxbold{Combining Satisfaction and Frustration}
Perhaps due to the relative simplicity of these heuristics, identical approaches have also been defined elsewhere in the literature.~\cite{kraft1979stopping_rules} later defined three further stopping heuristics, two of which are the \emph{satiation} and the somewhat loaded \emph{disgust} heuristics. In essence, the rules defined by~\cite{kraft1979stopping_rules} are the same satisfaction and disgust heuristics as previously defined by~\cite{cooper1973retrieval_effectiveness_ii}. Within the satiation rule, a searcher will stop after been \emph{satiated} by finding a number of documents considered to be relevant, while the disgust rule considers a searcher's disgust at finding a number of non-relevant documents.

\cite{kraft1979stopping_rules} also proposed a third heuristic that \emph{combines} both the satisfaction/satiation and frustration/disgust rules together into a single heuristic. Here, a searcher following such an approach would be inclined to stop examining content if they were either satisfied with what had been found, or frustrated by having to trawl through a number of material judged to be non-relevant. The stopping point would be whatever of the two conditions are met first. Indeed,~\cite{kraft1979stopping_rules} demonstrated that the expected search length of a searcher could be approximated using each of the two stopping heuristics by considering the size of the retrieval set, the number of relevant documents a searcher wished to obtain, and the number of non-relevant documents a searcher would be willing to tolerate. The number of documents required to consider a search as successful is dependent upon whether the search task is high precision (where one would stop comparatively early), or high recall (where one would stop comparatively later), as hypothesised by~\cite{bates1984thirty_items}.

\subsubsection{Magnitude Threshold}
The magnitude threshold heuristic, as outlined by~\citep{nickles1995judgment}, considers an individual's belief that the information accrued during the search process provides sufficient \emph{evidence} to prompt him or her to stop searching for information. The point at which the searcher would decide to stop is determined by some predetermined, internal threshold that must be reached, which acts as the stopping criterion~\citep{wald1948sequential_analysis, nickles1995judgment}.~\cite{gettys1979hypothesis} hypothesise that the searcher \emph{`mentally tabulates'} the cumulative impact of the evidence that he or she has uncovered, and when the internal tabulation crosses the specified threshold, he or she stops.

Determining what exactly this threshold should be before commencing a task has attracted research from several perspectives. Indeed, this decision can be left open to interpretation by the individuals who choose to operationalise such a heuristic. However, research has shown that under different tasks, varying the criteria by which an individual bases their initial threshold value varies. For example,~\cite{busemeyer1982choice_behaviour} demonstrated this for decision making under uncertainty.~\cite{saad1996stopping} demonstrated the usefulness of this heuristic under common choice tasks.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.45\textwidth}

    \caption[The magnitude threshold stopping heuristic]{The magnitude threshold stopping heuristic. Once a searcher accrues a predetermined level of impact, he or she stops. Figure adapted from~\cite{browne2004stopping_rules}.}
    \label{fig:threshold}
\end{wrapfigure}

An abstract representation of the stopping heuristic is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:threshold}. From the figure, we can see that a searcher accrues information through each document that is examined. This is combined together to form a \emph{cumulative impact} for the information. For each document examined, the current cumulative impact value is compared against a predetermined threshold value -- if the cumulative impact appears to be above the threshold, the searcher then assumes that enough supporting evidence has been collected, and subsequently stops.

\subsubsection{Difference Threshold}
Again outlined by~\citep{nickles1995judgment}, the \emph{difference threshold heuristic} concerns whether a new document is teaching a searcher anything new about their given information need, or the marginal value of the latest document. Here, the searcher is assumed to keep an internal record of the cumulative impact of information that has been consumed along some key dimension. The searcher is also assumed to use this internal record of what has been assessed to compare a new document with previously examined content. When the absolute difference between the two assessments falls below some internal difference threshold, the searcher would then stop as nothing new is being learnt.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \resizebox{1\hsize}{!}{
    \includegraphics{figures/ch3-difference.pdf}}
    \caption[Difference threshold heuristic]{A simplified, visual example of the difference threshold heuristic. Given the information need of finding different species of animal, a searcher issues a query, and examined a number of documents. The third document offers information on dogs, which has been already observed in \blueboxbold{Doc 1}. Using the stopping criterion that once the same species has been observed twice, \blueboxbold{Doc 5} satisfies it – and thus, the searcher stops.}
    \label{fig:difference_heuristic}
\end{figure}

As a crude example of this heuristic, a searcher is provided with an information need to find as many different species of animal as possible. Once a query has been issued, the searcher begins to examine documents on the SERP. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:difference_heuristic}, where the first document considers dogs. A simple criterion is employed whereby the searcher stops after encountering the same animal twice, illustrating that nothing new is being learnt from the list of results presented. Once this is met, the searcher abandons the SERP, and can then perform a query reformulation to discover different species of animal.

\subsubsection{Single Criterion}
The \emph{single criterion heuristic} was later defined by~\cite{browne2005stopping_rules}. As the name suggests, this heuristic considers a searcher examining information for a \emph{single criterion} related to their information need, typically assumed to be the most important one. The searcher then stops examining content once he or she has deduced that enough information about said criterion has been accumulated for them to be satisfied. The concept of a stopping threshold can be borrowed from the magnitude threshold heuristic. This considers that a searcher will stop once they have accumulated enough impactful information.

\cite{browne2005stopping_rules} go on to provide an example search task where the single criterion threshold would be directly applicable. When purchasing a mortgage for a new house, a searcher will explore various mortgage lender's websites in order to find the best deal. Given a mortgage deal, the most obvious criterion that an individual would look for would be interest rates -- the lower, the more attractive the deal. Of course, other factors may influence the decision, but this example ultimately demonstrates a potential application of the heuristic.

\subsection{Reasoning Based Heuristics}
The second category of stopping heuristics as defined by~\citep{nickles1995judgment} are \emph{reasoning based}. While searching and accruing information about a particular topic, a searcher is essentially developing a form of mental representation of the various elements of the topic as he or she learns~\citep{yates1990decision_making}. As argued by~\citep{nickles1995judgment}, these elements can include arguments constructed during informal reasoning, previously constructed arguments, or information evoked from the searcher's long term memory. As such,~\citep{nickles1995judgment} devised a category of stopping heuristics that are dominated by the searcher's reasoning processes, rather than purely judgement making.

\subsubsection{Representational Stability}

\subsubsection{Propositional Stability}

\subsubsection{Mental List}

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \resizebox{1\hsize}{!}{
    \includegraphics{figures/ch3-mental_list.pdf}}
    \caption[The mental list stopping heuristic]{Given a well defined information need,~\cite{nickles1995judgment} defined the mental list heuristic – where a number of different criteria must be satisfied before stopping. In the illustration above, car shopping is used as an example. Here, certain criteria for a new car (as shown on the notepad) must be met before a searcher is satisfied with what they have found.}
    \label{fig:mental_list}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Summary of Heuristics}
- applicable in difference circumstances.
- which one works better?

-if you don't know much, using the mental list rule might be impossible -- you don't know enough on the topic to be able to formulate a set of criteria that you must then extract information for and judge~\citep{browne2005stopping_rules}.

- so it would be more likely to work better for tasks in which you are familiar, as an example.

- same applies for single criterion -- you don't know anything about a topic, so you can't say what the most important factor is to judge your reasoning on. might however be used by those less knowledgeable, and has indeed been observed in user behaviour before~\cite{gigerenzer1999betting}.

- browne2005 hypothesises that in familiar tasks, you should use the threshold and mental list rules.

- additional rules are encoded within theories of interaction, etc. keep reading for more information on these.
