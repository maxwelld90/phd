\chapter[A Background of Stopping in IIR]{A Background of Stopping in\\Interactive Information Retrieval}\label{chap:stopping_background}

- given you an outline of the basics of IR
- and more system-sided IR

- including a discussion on some of the various measures that are used
- still very naive in terms of \emph{stopping behaviour}. i.e. assume fixed depths, typically naive about relevance.

- so in this chapter, we begin to consider things from the central point of this thesis - stopping during search.

\end{figure}

- to this end, we in this chapter discuss:

- a variety of different stopping heuristics
- discuss the basic theories that can be used to explain one's stopping behaviour;
- and explain the results from different user studies examining a searcher's stopping behaviour

- we then take time to examine

- some of the more complex models of search which are better able to capture stopping.


\section{Stopping Heuristics}\label{sec:stopping_background:heuristics}

\section{User Studies}
ryen white's expert stuff -- does he report stopping stuff?

depth first vs breadth first??

conceptual models (e.g. following on from TREC, we end up with...thomas, baskaya...), then move on to theoretical models

like we mentioned in Ch2, in the different measures, we have different stopping rules encoded within them.
e.g. Carterette's 2011 model.

\section{Models of Search}

\subsection{Conceptual Models}
The Berry Picking Model

\subsection{Information Foraging Theory}

\subsection{(Interactive) Probability Ranking Principle}

\subsection{Search Economic Theory}

\subsection{Simple TREC User Model}

\subsection{Paul Thomas Model}

\subsection{Feza Model}

Need to illustrate that there is a development of the user model here.

What about the attention model in ``Beyond ten blue links: enabling user click modeling in federated web search''?

    \caption[Model of the search process by~\cite{baskaya2013behavioural_factors}]{The user model of search, as outlined by~\citealt{baskaya2013behavioural_factors}. Represented as a Markov Model, the model considers six steps in all. Encoded within two of the steps are decision points that a user following this model must consider in order to continue.

    \caption[Model of the search process by~\cite{thomas2014modelling_behaviour}]{A model of the search process, considering the high-level processes undertaken by a searcher, as outlined by~\cite{thomas2014modelling_behaviour}. Also included are a number of decision points (represented as diamonds) that searchers must consider when following this model.

Refer to the following chapter for more information on how we extend these models to make them more realistic.
