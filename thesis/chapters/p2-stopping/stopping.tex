Need to illustrate that there is a development of the user model here.

    \caption[Model of the search process by~\cite{baskaya2013behavioural_factors}]{The user model of search, as outlined by~\citealt{baskaya2013behavioural_factors}. Represented as a Markov Model, the model considers six steps in all. Encoded within two of the steps are decision points that a user following this model must consider in order to continue.

    \caption[Model of the search process by~\cite{thomas2014modelling_behaviour}]{A model of the search process, considering the high-level processes undertaken by a searcher, as outlined by~\cite{thomas2014modelling_behaviour}. Also included are a number of decision points (represented as diamonds) that searchers must consider when following this model.

Refer to the following chapter for more information on how we extend these models to make them more realistic.
