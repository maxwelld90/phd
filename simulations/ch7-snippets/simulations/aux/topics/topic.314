Marine Vegetation

Commercial harvesting of marine vegetation such as algae, seaweed and kelp for food and drug purposes.  

Recent research has shown that marine vegetation is a valuable source of both food (human and animal) and a potentially useful drug.  This search will focus primarily on these two uses.  Also to be considered relevant would be instances of other possible commercial uses such as fertilizer, etc.
