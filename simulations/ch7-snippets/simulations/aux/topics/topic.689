family-planning aid

To which countries does the U.S. provide aid to support family planning, and for which countries has the U.S. refused or limited support?  

Relevant documents indicate where U.S. aid supports family planning or where such aid has been denied. Discussions of why aid for family planning has been refused are also relevant.  Documents that mention U.S. aid to countries, but not specifically for family planning are not relevant. Descriptions of funds for family planning in the U.S. itself are not relevant.
