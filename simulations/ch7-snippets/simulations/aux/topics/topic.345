Health studies primarily in the U.S. have caused reductions in tobacco sales here, but the economic impact has caused U.S. tobacco companies to look overseas for customers. What impact have the health and economic factors had overseas?  

To be relevant, an item will discuss either an increase or decrease in the sales of U.S. tobacco products overseas, and attribute this to health findings or more aggressive marketing by U.S. companies or the foreign companies they own or cooperate with.
