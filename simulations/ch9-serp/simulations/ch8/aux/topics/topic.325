Cult Lifestyles

Describe a cult by name and identify the cult members' activities in their everyday life.  

A relevant document would include the name of the cult and offer information about the members' lifestyles. It may include how they dress or what they do to attain the ultimate goal of the organization.  A relevant document may tell what they eat or how they contribute to the cult.  Just the mention of the existence of a cult by name with no other clarifying information would not be relevant.
