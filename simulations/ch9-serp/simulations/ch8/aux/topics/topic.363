What disasters have occurred in tunnels used for transportation?  

A relevant document identifies a disaster in a tunnel used for trains, motor vehicles, or people.  Wind tunnels and tunnels used for wiring, sewage, water, oil, etc. are not relevant.  The cause of the problem may be fire, earthquake, flood, or explosion and can be accidental or planned.  Documents that discuss tunnel disasters occurring during construction of a tunnel are relevant if lives were threatened.
