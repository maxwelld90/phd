tropical storms

What tropical storms (hurricanes and typhoons) have caused significant property damage and loss of life?  

The date of the storm, the area affected, and the extent of damage/casualties are all of interest.  Documents that describe the damage caused by a tropical storm as "slight", "limited", or "small" are not relevant.
