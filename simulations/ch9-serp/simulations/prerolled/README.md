The same prerolled judgement files are used for these experiments as used in experimentation for Chapters 7 and 8.
For the SERP decision point (stochastic, we seed the random number generator).
This means that for a query issued to the same index and retrieval system, the same set of results will be returned.
And if we use the same viewport threshold, that therefore means the same results will be considered for the viewport precision threshold.
Hence, the same results are spat out each time. Ergo, the stochastic component will produce repeatable results.
