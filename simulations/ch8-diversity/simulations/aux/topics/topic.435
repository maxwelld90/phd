curbing population growth

What measures have been taken worldwide and what countries have been effective in curbing population growth?  

A relevant document must describe an actual case in which population measures have been taken and their results are known. The reduction measures must have been actively pursued; that is, passive events such as disease or famine involuntarily reducing the population are not relevant.
