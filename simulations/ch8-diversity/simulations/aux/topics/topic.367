piracy

What modern instances have there been of old fashioned piracy, the boarding or taking control of boats?  

Documents discussing piracy on any body of water are relevant.  Documents discussing the legal taking of ships or their contents by a national authority are non-relevant.  Clashes between fishing vessels over fishing are not relevant, unless one vessel is boarded.
