Radio Waves and Brain Cancer

Evidence that radio waves from radio towers or car phones affect brain cancer occurrence.  

Persons living near radio towers and more recently persons using car phones have been diagnosed with brain cancer.  The argument rages regarding the direct association of one with the other. The incidence of cancer among the groups cited is considered, by some, to be higher than that found in the normal population.  A relevant document includes any experiment with animals, statistical study, articles, news items which report on the incidence of brain cancer being higher/lower/same as those persons who live near a radio tower and those using car phones as compared to those in the general population.
