Airport Security

A relevant document would discuss how effective government orders to better scrutinize passengers and luggage on international flights and to step up screening of all carry-on baggage has been.  

A relevant document would contain reports on what new steps airports worldwide have taken to better scrutinize passengers and their luggage on international flights and to step up screening of all carry-on baggage.  With the increase in international terrorism and in the wake of the TWA Flight 800 disaster, articles on airport security relating in particular to additional steps taken by airports to increase flight safety would be relevant.  The mere mention of enhanced security does not constitute relevance.  Additional steps refer to something beyond just passenger and carry-on screening using the normal methods. Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, and extraordinary measures to check luggage in the baggage compartment.
