wrongful convictions

Find documents that discuss freed prisoners who have been wrongfully convicted based on faulty forensic evidence, poor police work, or false testimony.  

Documents about political prisoners who were freed because of incompetent prosecutions are relevant.   However, documents that discuss prisoners who are pardoned or released on bond when their convictions are overturned are not relevant, nor are documents about prisoners freed to make a political statement or prisoners freed for an exchange.
