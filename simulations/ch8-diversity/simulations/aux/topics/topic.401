foreign minorities, Germany

What language and cultural differences impede the integration of foreign minorities in Germany?  

A relevant document will focus on the causes of the lack of integration in a significant way; that is, the mere mention of immigration difficulties is not relevant.  Documents that discuss immigration problems unrelated to Germany are also not relevant.
