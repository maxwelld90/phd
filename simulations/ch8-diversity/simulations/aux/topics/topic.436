railway accidents

What are the causes of railway accidents throughout the world?  

A relevant document provides data on railway accidents of any sort (i.e., locomotive, trolley, streetcar) where either the railroad system or the vehicle or pedestrian involved caused the accident.  Documents that discuss railroading in general, new rail lines, new technology for safety, and safety and accident prevention are not relevant, unless an actual accident is described.
